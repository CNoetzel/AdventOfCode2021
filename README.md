# Advent of code 2021

This repository contains my solutions for [advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
It's my fist time programming with python so don't expect too much magical stuff. 

## Testing
To execute all tests install [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) via `pip install pytest` and run `pytest *.py`.
